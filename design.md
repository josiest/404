# Art Project Design
- Blank page with "Utopia" hyperlink in large bold font
- when you click the hyperlink, the text breaks up into peices and the coloring goes from blue to black and not underlined, as if the link became broken
- the characters move away from the mouse - with the same attraction as two similarly charged particles
